CRMODataApp
===========
App featuring the iOS Data SDK

The app can be used in three different modes:
- Online (default)
- Offline (relies on the OData offline store)
- Demo mode

When used in online mode, one can edit, create or delete entities*.

(*)The endpoint URL and app ID must be filled in in order for the app to work. 
This can be done within Settings -> SAPCRMOData (see screenshot). Also, a valid user name and a password is required - except for demo mode.

MobileSDK frameworks used:
- ODataAPI
- OData Online
- OData Offline
- HTTPConversation
- MAFLogonManager
- Supportability (for logging and tracing)
- further libraries required due to dependencies
